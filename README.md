# Coding Contest 2024 25.10.2024 Library

## Description

This is my library for the coding contest 2024.

## Usage

### Setup

If you want you can configure some settings in the Settings.cs file.

### Files

- You need to copy the input files into the input folder configured in Settings.cs.
- The output files will be generated in the output folder configured in Settings.cs.
- You can write a test input into the test input folder configured in Settings.cs.
- The test output will be generated in the test output folder configured in Settings.cs.

### Coding

- You can start coding in the Program.cs file.
- Write your code in the Solution method.
- You will get a List<string> as input and you need to return a List<string> as output.
- The input and output files will be read and written automatically.

### Testing
- You can uncomment the test method in the Program.cs file.
```csharp
Master.Test();
```
- This will read the test input files and see if the output is equivalent to the one given in the test output file => that is the expected output.
